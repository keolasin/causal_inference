## Statistical Parameters

Provide a summary of a data distribution based on a sample drawn from that distribution.

- suppose we sample individuals from some well-specified population, and on each we observe:
  - A: indicator of vitamin use
  - Y: indicator of breast cancer
- Then we can estimate the association between A and Y in the population

P(Y=1 | A=1)
P(Y=1 | A=0)

Tells us about probabilities of past events

- extend to future events only if we assume the conditions did not change
